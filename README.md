# TinyML Gesture Recognition with TensorFlow and Arduino

# Overview

This project focuses on training a TinyML model to recognize two awesome gestures: flex ðŸ’ª and punch ðŸ‘Š. By leveraging TensorFlow and Arduino's Tiny Machine Learning Kit, we've created a compact solution for gesture-based interactions.
